# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-28

- ships the required `description` field in the Claude Code marketplace manifest (previously only on `main`, missing from the v0.1.1 tag);
- documents the marketplace-based Claude Code install flow as the primary method, keeping `--plugin-dir` for development;
- clarifies that record ID sequences (`MAT-`, `PROP-`, `RUN-`, `ADR-`) are local to each installation and start at `000`;
- removes internal author-history record IDs from the public README and validation record so fresh installations start their own sequences;
- adds Claude Code community-marketplace submission data alongside the existing OpenAI directory listing.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-28

- replaces the initial complex logo with the approved minimal magnifying-glass, shield, and check mark;

- reduces the PNG asset size while improving small-size legibility.
